Hi! I'm Salman. Enthusiast "Front end developer" (HTML, CSS, Javascript, React) at Novi Hogeschool. I have been learning a lot during my booth camp and have a basic understanding for front end development. I am almost done with my bootcamp and very excited to find a place for myself where I could learn more and grow.
